    ## About This Feature

    This feature automatically fetches warp history from the game and displays the pity count. To use this, you need to get the URL below.
    
    **Prob of Getting ☆5 in the Next 10 Pulls** refers to the chance of obtaining at least one ★5 item in the upcoming
    10 attempts, based on the number of past attempts. This calculation takes into account the soft pity system, but
    it is based on estimation and may differ from the actual probabilities. 

    ## About Security

    The URL used in this feature has an access key that allows only fetching warp history.
    Therefore, it cannot be used to access personal information such as email addresses and usernames,
    or to log in to the game. Please be assured.

    Also, when data sync is turned on, this URL is synchronized between devices.
    This URL is never sent to external parties except for the API for history retrieval and the database for sync.

    ## Notes

    - <span class="font-weight-bold">This URL expires in 24 hours. After it expires, you need to get a new one in the same way.</span>
    - <span class="font-weight-bold">Currently, there is no way to get the URL on Android devices alone.</span>
