    ## About This Feature

    This feature automatically fetches @:{'common.gacha'} history from the game and displays the pity count. To use this, you need to get the URL below.

    ## About Security

    The URL used in this feature has an access key that allows only fetching @:{'common.gacha'} history. Therefore, it cannot be used to access personal information such as email addresses and usernames, or to log in to the game. Please be assured.

    Also, this access key is processed only in the memory of the server and is destroyed after the processing is completed. It will not be recorded in the log or sent to a server other than miHoYo's API.

    ## Notes

    - <span class="text-red">This URL expires in 24 hours. After it expires, you need to get a new one in the same way.</span>
    - <span class="text-red">Currently, there is no way to get the URL on Android devices alone.</span>
    - The URL is saved only in the device and will be retained even if you reload the page.
